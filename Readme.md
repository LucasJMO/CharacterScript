I'm making this for personal use in future projects and will log design decisions/compromises I go with here.

5/17/21 - So one of the things that I think is going to be really difficult about all of this is what stacks and what doesn't.
For example, trap sense gained from multiple sources stacks, but damage reduction does not. It's going to be a real pain 
cross referencing all the different kinds of damage reductions and this/that.
This is also why I want to almost always use '+=' for leveling up, because who knows if later on something I think is exclusive
stacks with something you can gain from another class? idk 3.X is full of annoying stuff like that.
